In Vitest, coverage reports are typically generated only after all tests have completed, and they often cover all files regardless of whether tests pass or fail. However, you can ensure coverage is generated even if some tests fail by using these steps:
	1.	Add the Coverage Plugin: Ensure you have @vitest/coverage-c8 or @vitest/coverage-istanbul installed as part of your Vitest setup. Run the following command if itâ€™s not already installed:

npm install --save-dev @vitest/coverage-c8


	2.	Configure Coverage Options in vite.config.js: In your Vitest configuration (within vite.config.js or vitest.config.ts), set up coverage options as follows:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { configDefaults } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'c8', // or 'istanbul' based on your setup
      all: true, // Include all files in coverage report
      reporter: ['text', 'lcov'], // Customize coverage report formats
      reportsDirectory: './coverage', // Directory for coverage reports
    },
    // Continue generating coverage reports even when tests fail
    passWithNoTests: true,
  },
})


	3.	Running Tests with Coverage: To ensure the report includes failing tests, you can run the command:

vitest run --coverage

This command will execute all tests and generate the coverage report in the specified directory even if some tests fail.

	4.	Check Coverage Report: After running, the coverage report will be located in the directory you specified (e.g., ./coverage). You can open the index.html file in this directory to view the coverage report in a browser.

This setup should provide you with a full coverage report that includes information from both passing and failing tests.
