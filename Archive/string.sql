Certainly! Letâ€™s break down the corrected SQL syntax and understand each component step by step.

### Objective:
We want to concatenate values from a particular column (`column_name`) in a table (`table_name`), separated by commas, and get this result as a single string in a new column called `aggregated_column`.

### The Corrected SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT 
    STUFF(
        (
            SELECT ',' + column_name
            FROM table_name
            ORDER BY column_name
            FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE
        ).value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)'), 
        1, 1, ''
    ) AS aggregated_column;
```

### Explanation:

#### 1. **Subquery:**
   ```sql
   (
       SELECT ',' + column_name
       FROM table_name
       ORDER BY column_name
       FOR XML PATH(''), TYPE
   )
   ```
   - **Purpose:** This subquery handles the concatenation of the column values.
   - **SELECT ',' + column_name:** This part adds a comma `,` before each value in `column_name`. For example, if the column contains `A`, `B`, and `C`, this would generate `,A`, `,B`, `,C`.
   - **ORDER BY column_name:** The values are ordered based on `column_name`. This ensures the concatenated result is in a predictable order.
   - **FOR XML PATH(''):** This is a special SQL Server technique used to concatenate row values into a single string. The `PATH('')` part ensures that the values are concatenated without any XML tags. It produces an XML fragment, but since we used `''` (empty string), the result is just plain text.
   - **TYPE and `.value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)')`:** The `TYPE` keyword tells SQL Server to return the result as an XML type. Then, `.value('.', 'NVARCHAR(MAX)')` extracts this XML content as a plain `NVARCHAR` string. Without these, the output would be in XML format.

#### 2. **STUFF Function:**
   ```sql
   STUFF(
       ...subquery...,
       1, 1, ''
   )
   ```
   - **Purpose:** The `STUFF` function is used to remove the first character from the concatenated string (which is an extra comma added by the subquery).
   - **1, 1, '':** These parameters tell the `STUFF` function to remove 1 character starting at position 1 and replace it with an empty string (`''`). This effectively removes the leading comma from the concatenated result.

#### 3. **Final Output:**
   - **AS aggregated_column:** The final result of the `STUFF` function is given an alias `aggregated_column`. This is the name of the output column that will contain the concatenated string.

### Example:
Suppose we have the following data in `table_name`:

| column_name |
|-------------|
| A           |
| B           |
| C           |

Running the above query would produce the following result:

| aggregated_column |
|-------------------|
| A,B,C             |

### Summary:
- **Subquery:** Generates a comma-separated list of values using `FOR XML PATH`.
- **STUFF:** Removes the leading comma introduced by the subquery.
- **Final Output:** A single concatenated string of all the values from `column_name`.

This approach is specific to SQL Server, leveraging its XML processing capabilities to efficiently concatenate rows into a single string.
