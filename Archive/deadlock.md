Deadlocks in SQL Server occur when two or more sessions block each other, typically due to locking conflicts. In your case, the `UPDATE` statement inside a stored procedure (SP) running within a transaction is causing a deadlock with another stored procedure executing a `SELECT` statement. 

Here are a few strategies to avoid or resolve the deadlock:

### 1. **Minimize Locking Time:**
   - Keep transactions as short as possible. The longer a transaction holds locks, the greater the chance of deadlocks.
   - If possible, avoid placing long-running operations (such as updates or complex calculations) inside transactions.
   
### 2. **Use Query Hints (NOLOCK):**
   - For the `SELECT` query in the other stored procedure, you can use the `NOLOCK` hint to allow dirty reads. This will avoid locking conflicts at the cost of potentially reading uncommitted data:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Table WITH (NOLOCK)
     ```

### 3. **Consistent Locking Order:**
   - Ensure that both stored procedures access tables in the same order. SQL Server resolves deadlocks by selecting the process with the least cost to roll back. When operations access resources in a consistent order, the chances of deadlock decrease.

### 4. **Lower Transaction Isolation Level:**
   - Consider lowering the transaction isolation level for the `SELECT` queries if it's acceptable to read uncommitted or intermediate data. For example:
     ```sql
     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
     ```

### 5. **Optimistic Concurrency:**
   - Switch from pessimistic locking (default) to optimistic concurrency where the system assumes that data conflicts will be rare. Use row versioning techniques (e.g., `SNAPSHOT ISOLATION`) to avoid locking between reads and writes.
     ```sql
     ALTER DATABASE YourDatabase
     SET ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_ISOLATION ON;
     ```

### 6. **Deadlock Priority:**
   - You can set the deadlock priority for a session. Lowering the priority of the less critical process can ensure that it gets chosen as the deadlock victim in case of conflict:
     ```sql
     SET DEADLOCK_PRIORITY LOW;
     ```

### 7. **Analyze Deadlock Graphs:**
   - Use SQL Server Profiler or the system health extended events session to capture deadlock graphs, which will help identify the root cause. You can analyze the graph to see which resources are involved in the deadlock.

### Example
In your `UPDATE` SP:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE TableA SET Col1 = @Value WHERE Col2 = @Condition;
COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

In your `SELECT` SP:
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED; 
SELECT * FROM TableA;
```

By adjusting isolation levels or lock hints, you can often resolve deadlocks.
